It is going to be two years since we made our trip to Aruba but memories of its turquoise-colored beaches, white sand and clear blue skies are still so vivid, that I am compelled to pen them down, finally. Aruba will always be close to our hearts, being the first vacation my husband and I took as a couple. Guess that makes it our honeymoon? Except, unlike most other people, we had no idea this would be our location until after the wedding! We were so overwhelmed by not only the wedding planning but a few other stresses at the time, that planning a honeymoon was the last thing on our minds. Instead, we decided to wait until the dust settled..the best decision we ever made! We were able to plan our honeymoon with a lot more excitement and patience than we would have, otherwise!

Before I mention how we settled on Aruba, I need to explain a couple of things. We got married in India (in May), which meant taking a three week vacation. This in turn meant settling for a short honeymoon- a minimoon, as my husband has reminded me on several occasions. Now, when it came to deciding on a location, we wanted the place to represent us-  one’s a beach-lover, and other is an adventure-seeker. If you live on the east coast of the U.S, there is only one area that can offer all of the above: The Caribbean islands. Phew! That didn’t take long to decide, except..

To make the most of our limited days off, we had to plan our trip around Labor Day Weekend, aka beginning of hurricane season in the Caribbean. As we were beginning to get nervous about our plans , a quick Google search revealed that Aruba was one of the few islands outside the hurricane belt! And as icing on the cake, offered us everything else we wanted, and more!

We really didn’t know much about Aruba before our trip. In fact, my only prior knowledge of the island was its reference in a F.R.I.E.N.D.S episode, can you guess which one?

But, don’t let me digress..

The minute we landed on this small island, located 15 miles north of Venezuela, we knew we were in for a treat. It is the only place so far, that has us waiting to re-visit. Here are a few reasons why:

* **Accessibility**: For anyone living on the East coast, reaching Aruba is a mere 5 hour flight. Much like other Caribbean islands, if you live in the North/South America, accessibility is not really an excuse you can use to not visit Aruba.
* **Budget-Friendly Options**: The flights from New Jersey To Oranjestad, Aruba were reasonably priced and although I am usually not a fan of United, we didn’t hit any bumps on the way (both literally and figuratively). The option of all-inclusive resorts also allowed us to get more value on our buck. We loved staying at-[Occidental Grand (now re-named, Barceló)](https://www.barcelo.com/en-us/barcelo-hotels/hotels/aruba/palm-beach/barcelo-aruba/), which brags of a private entrance to the pristine Palm Beach, along with 4 multi-cuisine restaurants, and a very helpful staff. During our stay, we never walked around without a drink or plate in hand. Our food, drinks and views were sorted for the next 4 days. Although as a disclaimer, I have to add that everything else in Aruba can get expensive, so plan well!
* **Weather & Climate**: Rest assured, there isn’t a bad time go to Aruba. With temperatures averaging at 82 degrees Fahrenheit and  less than 20 inches of rainfall every year, it is said to be the driest Caribbean island. It did rain for a couple of hours one day during our stay and the locals were just as surprised as we were! The rains stopped soon enough though, revealing the bright blue skies yet again, as if nothing had ever changed.
* **Perfectly Sized Island**: Aruba is a fairly small island, one that can be toured completely in 4 to 5 days, although, not everything is accessible by foot. We thought it had the perfect balance of offering many things to see/do and still evoke an intimate and cozy vibe! (Aah! Take me back already!)
* **Diverse**: We were surprised to find that Arubans can speak at least four languages, including their native tongue, Papiamento. With a population of just over 100,000, there are about 90 nationalities residing on this tiny island; diverse indeed! But it isn’t just the culture, but the landscape that is diverse as well. While there are calm blue waters on one side of the island, there are erratic, wild ones on the other. Even more interesting is the desert life. We didn’t realize this on our way from the airport to the resort but the first day we stepped out to explore the island,  giant cacti and rugged, rocky landscapes completely took us off guard! We had never seen such diverse terrains together before; much less on a small island
* **Things To Do**: There is no dearth of things to see and do in Aruba. Although you always have the option of doing nothing but bask in the Aruban Sun, with an adult beverage in hand, and still have a gala time! We wanted an adventurous honeymoon so we packed in as many thrills as we could. Whether it was riding rescue horses on the wild beaches, driving UTVs on the dusty, rugged terrains, or spending a whole day on the De palm beach snorkeling and zip-lining our way, each adventure gave us tons of memories that made this trip even more spectacular than we first imagined!

## The Wondering Wanderers' tips for couples:

1. Do reserve a beachside table for two in your resort or in restaurants offering these services, such as [Passion On The Beach](https://www.amsterdammanor.com/passions-on-the-beach) or [The Flying Fishbone](https://www.flyingfishbone.com/).

2. Do snuggle up during a sunset sailing cruise. [Jolly Pirates Cruises](https://www.jolly-pirates.com/) was our favorite find! Their tours include swimming, snorkeling, rope-swinging, and sunset cruises; who can say no to that, huh?
3. Don’t spend all your beach time at the famous Aruban beaches (aka Palm and Eagle). Instead, set a sublime mood in secluded, and lesser known beaches of [Santo Largo](http://beachesofaruba.com/aruba-beaches/santo-largo/) or [Mangel Halto](http://www.aruba.com/things-to-do/mangel-halto).
4. Don’t miss out on the [The Gold Mine Ranch](https://www.thegoldmineranch.com/) horse riding on the beach. Riding rescue horses on the wild beaches of North-East Aruba was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. The beautiful locations, wind blowing through your hair and a serene ambiance are just some of the elements that make this an ideal honeymoon activity.

5. Do take the time out to talk to locals and getting to know the history of Aruba. This Dutch island has a surprisingly interesting history behind it; and who knows, you may even be led to a couple of amazing historical sites (hint: look for [Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins](http://www.aruba.com/things-to-do/historic-gold-mines) and [California Lighthouse](https://arubalighthouse.com/)).
