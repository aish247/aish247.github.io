1. Nothing can match the feeling of seeing that BFP (Big Fat Positive). It’s a wild ride of excitement, nervousness, numbness and boundless happiness!
2. Be prepared to be constantly given unsolicited advise from everyone..even from people who don’t have a baby! #Patience
3. Pregnancy symptoms could range from “Stop overthinking everything!” to “Call your Doctor right away!” Good luck!
4. Google is your frenemy – can’t live with or without it!
5. The first weeks of the second trimester are spent wondering whether that growing belly is the baby or just bloating– both equally possible!
6. Soon enough, you’ll find your hand constantly reaching to rub your belly- there has to be a magnetic effect going on!
7. Not sure whether to be in awe or shock to learn of all the ways your body is making room for the new guest — like your abs stretching apart. Or, your uterus growing 300 times its original size! o.0
8. Getting unasked, unlimited massages from the husband, FTW!
9. Not sure which is scarier, the thought of giving birth, or standing on that weighing scale every week! GAH!
10. You realize how much you have taken simple acts like bending and sleeping on your back for granted all your life!
11. Being pregnant apparently gives people the right to ask the most private questions about your body, health and sex life!
12. My mother basically had one very important lesson to teach me throughout my pregnancy: Eat eggs daily. (She sent me a text every day to remind me! No joke!)
13. You will waddle like a penguin. It cannot be helped.
14. This irrevocably causes people to either call you “Cute” or “You are getting so big!”. There is no middle ground.
15. Hits you even harder when you escape the undesirable stretch marks until your last few weeks and then voila! Here they are! Here to stay!
16. Forever grateful for the few kind people who give up their seats on the train for you, because trust me, not many do!
17. So many scary things to learn about labor and delivery. Like, Episiotomy.  DO NOT GOOGLE IT.
18. Your body goes into a confused state of mind in those last few weeks. Mucus Plug? Dilated Cervix? Fake Labor? Early labor? Braxton Hicks? Send Help!
