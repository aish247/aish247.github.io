The start of this blog is a product of my boredom- quite possibly the reason of many other blogs out there! I have always had an opinion about everything and have written blogs in the past so this was a natural solution to my boredom. By nature, I am a jack of all trades sort of person. I have varied interests, from fashion to current affairs to entertainment and over the next few blog posts, as I discover my niche, I may simply end up writing about any and everything. So let us start with a topic that is currently looming over my head like a cannon ball- weddings!

I have come to the conclusion that any girl still delusional enough to think planning weddings is fun may not really be ready to settle down just yet! I was one of them, until very very recently. As I see my impending wedding right over the horizon, I realize that the joy of a wedding is actually just a mirage. Now I cannot speak for everyone, but as a little girl, I was always obsessed with weddings. I remember at age 11 day dreaming about stealing my mom’s old saris to wear at my wedding (at least I could be sold cheap!). I think it was the idea of looking my best and getting everyone’s attention that really convinced me that getting married is my ultimate goal in life.

I am just glad I grew out of the phase; albeit quite late. But today I see on YouTube these extravagant weddings that people can barely pay for – simply to show off among friends and relatives what they are worth. This trumpeting behavior has quite conspicuously been taken advantage of by the wedding industry. Last year, one of my friends got married and I was speechless when I learned that her wedding cost over $100,000! I mean wouldn’t you rather invest all that money for a new home or a car (or both)? I learned that venues (at least in some parts of the country) will not even book you if you do not hire a wedding planner! Is it just me or do you smell a web of legal looters?

Thankfully, my wedding will cost no where close to a hundred grand since I am getting married in India- but things here are no different. The situation here isn’t as bad as the U.S just yet, but it is well on its way. I am just glad I realized in time that what I saw across the horizon was a mere mirage or I could have been trapped just as easily. Let’s have a moment of silence for all those (including my lovely friend) who did succumb to it.
