1. Do not be quick to dismiss visiting Iceland in winter. It may lack the vibrant greens, and colorful rainbows you would see in the warmer months; but it will give you an otherworldly experience which is saved perhaps exclusively for the brave visitors.

2. Select your flight seats in advance. If you are flying from West of Iceland, make sure you book seats to the left of the aircraft, and right for those flying from the East. This arrangement makes sure you face the north; which of course gives you a first class view of the Northern Lights, if they decide to put on a show!

3. Package bus tours are overrated and should be avoided if possible; we think renting a car is the best way to enjoy Iceland. Not only do these bus tours give you a lack of control or flexibility to plan your day, you will also be constantly surrounded by a dozen of your fellow travelers at all times.
4. Aurora Essentials. If you are serious about hunting Northern Lights, vedur.is, and Northern Lights Alert FB group are almost necessary to have. Don’t need to book tours.

5. It is more than the lights. One of the biggest reasons we decided on Iceland in winter was because of the Northern Lights, but we soon realized it had so much more to offer! We know that we would have still had an amazing time if we hadn’t seen the lights.
6. Blue Lagoon: Probably the most commercialized place in all of Iceland, but would still recommend visiting. For us who seek the barren wilderness more, the crowded Lagoon didn’t impress us too much. But I am pretty certain we are in the minority!

7. Pack snacks and Ready to Eat meals. These were life savers and a must-have in your bag, especially for a road trip.
8. Road Check. Make sure you always check road conditions on road.is before your day begins, especially in the winter.

9. Getting lost is nearly impossible. There is no way you will get lost in Iceland. Once you are outside the city, you will practically be driving on route 1 majority of the time.
10. Don’t go by its name. Winter in Iceland is cold but not unbearable: Be prepared for the unpredictable and cold weather. Snow/waterproof boots and jacket, layers and gloves are essential. You can’t enjoy Iceland, especially in winter without packing the right attire. But if you are covered well, the beauty of Iceland will easily help you forget the sub-zero temperature around you.
