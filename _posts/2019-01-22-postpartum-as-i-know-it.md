1. While you will be thrilled to have your baby in your arms, the first four weeks are mostly spent in frustration, exhaustion, tears, and..copious amounts of blood.
2. ..But each day gets better.
3. You will miss your baby's kicks and nudges you enjoyed so much in those last few months of pregnancy.
4. Breastfeeding in public may have been intimidating at one point, but your hungry, crying baby will help you get over it in a second!
5. You won't recognize yourself in the mirror for a while..
6. ..But for the most part, your body will start going back to normal. For the most part!
7. All you hear during your pregnancy is to sleep as much as you can.. still, nothing prepares you for what is about to hit you!
8. It will be a while before you can get your cute and dainty Kate Spade handbag out, long live diaper bag!
9. Still not gotten your period? Hurraah!Â  It can take up to a year for breastfeeding moms, and you won't hear any of us complaining!
10. Say goodbye to all the luscious hair you had during pregnancy, they can now be found in your shower drain (gross, I know!)
