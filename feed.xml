        <title>10 Things You Should Know Before Visiting Iceland</title>
        <description>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not be quick to dismiss visiting Iceland in winter. It may lack the vibrant greens, and colorful rainbows you would see in the warmer months; but it will give you an otherworldly experience which is saved perhaps exclusively for the brave visitors.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/10thingsiceland1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select your flight seats in advance. If you are flying from West of Iceland, make sure you book seats to the left of the aircraft, and right for those flying from the East. This arrangement makes sure you face the north; which of course gives you a first class view of the Northern Lights, if they decide to put on a show!
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/10thingsiceland2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Package bus tours are overrated and should be avoided if possible; we think renting a car is the best way to enjoy Iceland. Not only do these bus tours give you a lack of control or flexibility to plan your day, you will also be constantly surrounded by a dozen of your fellow travelers at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aurora Essentials. If you are serious about hunting Northern Lights, vedur.is, and Northern Lights Alert FB group are almost necessary to have. Don’t need to book tours.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/10thingsiceland3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is more than the lights. One of the biggest reasons we decided on Iceland in winter was because of the Northern Lights, but we soon realized it had so much more to offer! We know that we would have still had an amazing time if we hadn’t seen the lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blue Lagoon: Probably the most commercialized place in all of Iceland, but would still recommend visiting. For us who seek the barren wilderness more, the crowded Lagoon didn’t impress us too much. But I am pretty certain we are in the minority!
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/10thingsiceland4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack snacks and Ready to Eat meals. These were life savers and a must-have in your bag, especially for a road trip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Road Check. Make sure you always check road conditions on road.is before your day begins, especially in the winter.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/10thingsiceland5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting lost is nearly impossible. There is no way you will get lost in Iceland. Once you are outside the city, you will practically be driving on route 1 majority of the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t go by its name. Winter in Iceland is cold but not unbearable: Be prepared for the unpredictable and cold weather. Snow/waterproof boots and jacket, layers and gloves are essential. You can’t enjoy Iceland, especially in winter without packing the right attire. But if you are covered well, the beauty of Iceland will easily help you forget the sub-zero temperature around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Being Pregnant - What I Know Now!</title>
        <description>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing can match the feeling of seeing that BFP (Big Fat Positive). It’s a wild ride of excitement, nervousness, numbness and boundless happiness!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be prepared to be constantly given unsolicited advise from everyone..even from people who don’t have a baby! #Patience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pregnancy symptoms could range from “Stop overthinking everything!” to “Call your Doctor right away!” Good luck!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google is your frenemy – can’t live with or without it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first weeks of the second trimester are spent wondering whether that growing belly is the baby or just bloating– both equally possible!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soon enough, you’ll find your hand constantly reaching to rub your belly- there has to be a magnetic effect going on!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not sure whether to be in awe or shock to learn of all the ways your body is making room for the new guest — like your abs stretching apart. Or, your uterus growing 300 times its original size! o.0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting unasked, unlimited massages from the husband, FTW!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not sure which is scarier, the thought of giving birth, or standing on that weighing scale every week! GAH!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You realize how much you have taken simple acts like bending and sleeping on your back for granted all your life!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being pregnant apparently gives people the right to ask the most private questions about your body, health and sex life!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My mother basically had one very important lesson to teach me throughout my pregnancy: Eat eggs daily. (She sent me a text every day to remind me! No joke!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will waddle like a penguin. It cannot be helped.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This irrevocably causes people to either call you “Cute” or “You are getting so big!”. There is no middle ground.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hits you even harder when you escape the undesirable stretch marks until your last few weeks and then voila! Here they are! Here to stay!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forever grateful for the few kind people who give up their seats on the train for you, because trust me, not many do!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So many scary things to learn about labor and delivery. Like, Episiotomy.  DO NOT GOOGLE IT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your body goes into a confused state of mind in those last few weeks. Mucus Plug? Dilated Cervix? Fake Labor? Early labor? Braxton Hicks? Send Help!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Iceland: The Land of Fire &amp; Ice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A fog followed our 4×4 as we drove south of Route 1, mystifying the snow-covered Tundra plains. The sky should have been pitch black at this time of the hour, but we notice hints of twilight wrapping, what seemed like a million stars, thanks to the reflection of the snow. As we began playing soundtracks of Game of Thrones, we were almost convinced that a group of white walkers were lurking behind the mist. This is what the Icelandic panorama does to you– as you try to make sense of what you are seeing, you will begin to believe what the Icelandic folklore and sagas have reiterated for centuries- there is some magic here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound ridiculous if you have never visited Iceland, but over 70% of Icelanders believe in whimsical creatures like elves, trolls and all things magical. After spending a few days here, it is not too hard to understand why. Being constantly pulled apart by the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates it nestles between, Iceland is also home to many geothermal hot springs, volcanic eruptions that create its unique black rocks and sand beaches and thriving but fragile moss heath. Add the magic of the Northern Lights to this list and it’s easy to forget that you are still on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can safely say that Iceland has been my most cathartic trip. There is an eerie sense of calm in the Icelandic air that forces you to be one with nature. Naturally, you learn a thing or two about such a place. And about yourself. Iceland is everything you hope it would be, yet nothing you expected. The people of Iceland have a gentle confidence in them that makes them approachable and friendly, but not naive. A historical land where the world’s first democracy was formed (930 AD), it is also a land that has been standing tall without any armed forces since the 19th Century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fittingly called The Land of Fire and Ice, it does not take long to notice that its unique beauty lies in its thriving dichotomy.  While it is home to scalding lava, erupting geysers, and active volcanoes, it is also a haven for gushing waterfalls, wild beaches and massive glaciers. Iceland is a popular destination and gets over 2.2 million visitors every year (and rising), but continuing with its theme of contrasts, there were several locations where we felt like the first ones exploring a barren, untouched land. Most tours buses and other big groups limit their explorations to Reykjavik city and the Golden Circle, mainly because of the unpredictable road conditions past that point. But dare to go beyond, because therein lie the most striking views of  land, ice and rugged tundra plains, you’ll ever see. It was this rugged wilderness of Iceland that we were most thrilled to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Iceland should be on everyone’s bucket list, the truth is, it may not be for everyone. At any given point in the year, unpredictable weather, planning the trip around shorter days, and frequent road closures are some challenges you must be prepared for. I am a big planner myself and usually have a solid itinerary for every trip we make. But the minute we landed into a torrential snow storm that lasted about 15 minutes before we were greeted by the Sun (followed by some more snow), I knew my well-planned itinerary was going for a toss. But surprisingly for the very first time, I was able to enjoy a vacation not despite the curve balls thrown at us, but because of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stop resisting nature’s madness, and savor every moment come rain or shine, Iceland will magically (there’s that word again!) transform for you.  You’ll see the gloomy weather accentuating the mood of the black sand beach. And the rain melting away the snow, revealing a layer of Iceland to you. The only difference between a bad and a good weather day, is our own perception of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iceland4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tourists probably prefer Iceland in its warmer months, and we can’t wait to go back there for a summer trip ourselves (you really can’t get enough of Iceland!) But with this trip, we wanted to step out of our comfort zone and challenge the conventional definition of a vacation. Because life in Iceland is so unpredictable, our trip probably ended up being slightly different than what we originally imagined, yet, it was the smoothest, most perfect trip we have ever taken. We explored everything we had planned to explore, yet there was an inexplicable novelty to it . The so-called challenges made this trip all the more adventurous and spontaneous. And most of all, it succeeded in expanding our boundaries of a vacation. You know what they say, “Out of your comfort zone is where the magic happens”. Well, this couldn’t be truer for Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ARUBA: One Happy Island</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is going to be two years since we made our trip to Aruba but memories of its turquoise-colored beaches, white sand and clear blue skies are still so vivid, that I am compelled to pen them down, finally. Aruba will always be close to our hearts, being the first vacation my husband and I took as a couple. Guess that makes it our honeymoon? Except, unlike most other people, we had no idea this would be our location until after the wedding! We were so overwhelmed by not only the wedding planning but a few other stresses at the time, that planning a honeymoon was the last thing on our minds. Instead, we decided to wait until the dust settled..the best decision we ever made! We were able to plan our honeymoon with a lot more excitement and patience than we would have, otherwise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I mention how we settled on Aruba, I need to explain a couple of things. We got married in India (in May), which meant taking a three week vacation. This in turn meant settling for a short honeymoon- a minimoon, as my husband has reminded me on several occasions. Now, when it came to deciding on a location, we wanted the place to represent us-  one’s a beach-lover, and other is an adventure-seeker. If you live on the east coast of the U.S, there is only one area that can offer all of the above: The Caribbean islands. Phew! That didn’t take long to decide, except..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the most of our limited days off, we had to plan our trip around Labor Day Weekend, aka beginning of hurricane season in the Caribbean. As we were beginning to get nervous about our plans , a quick Google search revealed that Aruba was one of the few islands outside the hurricane belt! And as icing on the cake, offered us everything else we wanted, and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aruba1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really didn’t know much about Aruba before our trip. In fact, my only prior knowledge of the island was its reference in a F.R.I.E.N.D.S episode, can you guess which one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, don’t let me digress..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute we landed on this small island, located 15 miles north of Venezuela, we knew we were in for a treat. It is the only place so far, that has us waiting to re-visit. Here are a few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;: For anyone living on the East coast, reaching Aruba is a mere 5 hour flight. Much like other Caribbean islands, if you live in the North/South America, accessibility is not really an excuse you can use to not visit Aruba.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget-Friendly Options&lt;/strong&gt;: The flights from New Jersey To Oranjestad, Aruba were reasonably priced and although I am usually not a fan of United, we didn’t hit any bumps on the way (both literally and figuratively). The option of all-inclusive resorts also allowed us to get more value on our buck. We loved staying at-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barcelo.com/en-us/barcelo-hotels/hotels/aruba/palm-beach/barcelo-aruba/&quot;&gt;Occidental Grand (now re-named, Barceló)&lt;/a&gt;, which brags of a private entrance to the pristine Palm Beach, along with 4 multi-cuisine restaurants, and a very helpful staff. During our stay, we never walked around without a drink or plate in hand. Our food, drinks and views were sorted for the next 4 days. Although as a disclaimer, I have to add that everything else in Aruba can get expensive, so plan well!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather &amp;amp; Climate&lt;/strong&gt;: Rest assured, there isn’t a bad time go to Aruba. With temperatures averaging at 82 degrees Fahrenheit and  less than 20 inches of rainfall every year, it is said to be the driest Caribbean island. It did rain for a couple of hours one day during our stay and the locals were just as surprised as we were! The rains stopped soon enough though, revealing the bright blue skies yet again, as if nothing had ever changed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfectly Sized Island&lt;/strong&gt;: Aruba is a fairly small island, one that can be toured completely in 4 to 5 days, although, not everything is accessible by foot. We thought it had the perfect balance of offering many things to see/do and still evoke an intimate and cozy vibe! (Aah! Take me back already!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse&lt;/strong&gt;: We were surprised to find that Arubans can speak at least four languages, including their native tongue, Papiamento. With a population of just over 100,000, there are about 90 nationalities residing on this tiny island; diverse indeed! But it isn’t just the culture, but the landscape that is diverse as well. While there are calm blue waters on one side of the island, there are erratic, wild ones on the other. Even more interesting is the desert life. We didn’t realize this on our way from the airport to the resort but the first day we stepped out to explore the island,  giant cacti and rugged, rocky landscapes completely took us off guard! We had never seen such diverse terrains together before; much less on a small island&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things To Do&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no dearth of things to see and do in Aruba. Although you always have the option of doing nothing but bask in the Aruban Sun, with an adult beverage in hand, and still have a gala time! We wanted an adventurous honeymoon so we packed in as many thrills as we could. Whether it was riding rescue horses on the wild beaches, driving UTVs on the dusty, rugged terrains, or spending a whole day on the De palm beach snorkeling and zip-lining our way, each adventure gave us tons of memories that made this trip even more spectacular than we first imagined!
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aruba3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wondering-wanderers-tips-for-couples&quot;&gt;The Wondering Wanderers’ tips for couples:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do reserve a beachside table for two in your resort or in restaurants offering these services, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsterdammanor.com/passions-on-the-beach&quot;&gt;Passion On The Beach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flyingfishbone.com/&quot;&gt;The Flying Fishbone&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aruba4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do snuggle up during a sunset sailing cruise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jolly-pirates.com/&quot;&gt;Jolly Pirates Cruises&lt;/a&gt; was our favorite find! Their tours include swimming, snorkeling, rope-swinging, and sunset cruises; who can say no to that, huh?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t spend all your beach time at the famous Aruban beaches (aka Palm and Eagle). Instead, set a sublime mood in secluded, and lesser known beaches of &lt;a href=&quot;http://beachesofaruba.com/aruba-beaches/santo-largo/&quot;&gt;Santo Largo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aruba.com/things-to-do/mangel-halto&quot;&gt;Mangel Halto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t miss out on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegoldmineranch.com/&quot;&gt;The Gold Mine Ranch&lt;/a&gt; horse riding on the beach. Riding rescue horses on the wild beaches of North-East Aruba was one of the biggest highlights of our trip. The beautiful locations, wind blowing through your hair and a serene ambiance are just some of the elements that make this an ideal honeymoon activity.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aruba5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do take the time out to talk to locals and getting to know the history of Aruba. This Dutch island has a surprisingly interesting history behind it; and who knows, you may even be led to a couple of amazing historical sites (hint: look for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aruba.com/things-to-do/historic-gold-mines&quot;&gt;Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://arubalighthouse.com/&quot;&gt;California Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>'I Had The Disease of Pleasing People'- Oprah Winfrey</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The crowd roared in unison as the amazing Oprah Winfrey walked across the stage at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Las Vegas. My presence in the hall that day, being in the same room as her, was purely serendipitous and I took none of it for granted. “I had the disease of pleasing people” were her first words and I knew right then she was speaking to me. As I strained my ears to listen to every word she spoke, the crowd, the applause that filled the room and my manager who was sitting next to me, suddenly disappeared into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she began sharing her story, I quickly learned that the journey of the Oprah Winfrey Show ran parallel with her own. At first, much like the rest of us in our early twenties, Oprah was happy, simply to have a job. The show in its early years was primarily decided by the producers, even inviting white nationalists in one of the episodes. But that episode changed everything. From that day on, she confronted the Producers to allow her to decide who came to the show, not because they spewed racial spurs at her throughout the show, or because she felt uncomfortable and targeted, but because she realized she was providing them a platform- to spread hatred and negativity out in the world. That fateful episode helped her realize her purpose in life- to elevate people, and to use her show as a force for good. But merely knowing the direction you want to take your show to fulfill your purpose is not enough. If you are or have ever been a people-pleaser, you will know how challenging it is to refuse. Even for Oprah Winfrey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time in my life, I refused to believe that being a people pleaser was even a weakness. I think there is a thin line between compassion and people pleasing. Pleasing behavior arises when compassion spills into worrying about what others think of you. I realized I needed to make a change in my mindset when I started noticing how my actions made me feel. I not only felt negatively towards the favor I unwillingly agreed to do, but also towards the person who asked for it. I started seeing a shift in my own behavior when I made peace with the fact that not everyone will like me, and that was okay. I realized it took too much work to impress everyone and it really came down to giving myself as much importance as I used to give others, if not more. The struggle does not end there, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge of being a people pleaser is, dealing with the guilt that follows after you have learned to add ‘no’ to your vocabulary. It is a slow-moving journey and believe it or not, Oprah admitted to struggling with it for years, until she read, ‘The Seat of the Soul’ by Gary Zukav. The revelation that the energy behind what you say and how you say it has power, changed everything for her. For instance, you are asked a favor that you do not wish to do but the classic people pleaser will agree to do it anyway. You may pat yourself on the back for ‘sacrificing’ your feelings to help a friend out but really, by attaching negative sentiments to it, you send out negative energy, so what is the point of doing it at all?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a classic people-pleaser for most of my 28 years of existence, but one fine day,  I woke up on the right side of the bed and decided to make some changes. In the hopes that someone, somewhere might find it helpful, here are a few revelations I have had over the years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept that you will disappoint people. Not everyone can be or needs to be pleased, and that is more than okay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is a voice inside nudging you right before you are about to commit to something unwanted– listen to it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop over-analyzing everything! This is the number one reason for that dreaded ‘post-no’ guilt. When you find yourself over-thinking, stop and nip that sucker right in the bud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saying ‘yes’ does not make you a nice person- if anything, being honest to the person and yourself does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, lastly, have patience- this takes time. It took even Oprah Winfrey several years to get to where she is right now. And while everyone’s journey is different, I can promise that when you liberate yourself from the bounds of people-pleasing, the taste of freedom is so sweet, you will never want to look back!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 Types of Friends You Will Meet in Your Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;They say friends are the family you choose for yourself. The meaning of friendship changes as we grow older. So, here is my theory about the evolution of friendship: It is common sense that as we grow older, so does our circle of friends. By virtue of expanding our horizons and going up in life, our connections grow and before we know it, we have our plates full and our social life, is bustling. This is the crest of our social life. It is all downhill from here, my friend! Because at this crest we realize, quantity can never equal quality; just because we know a lot of people, does not necessarily mean we have more meaningful friendships. With this epiphany and little more maturity, we begin to create our inner circle of friends by evaluating the candidates in this elite category. It is a slippery slope and we do not always succeed. Here is a list of some of the types of friends you will meet along the way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Mentor&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the kind of friend that great friendship stories are made of. We all need that one friend who inspires us to be better people without judging us or trying to change us. They are always filled with positive energy and every time you meet them, their infectious positivity rubs off on you as well. I have had the pleasure of meeting more than one of these and they enrich your life like no other. My mentor-friend from high school is not necessarily the best at keeping in touch but I will always consider her one of my closest friends because I respect her for her thoughts and the level of maturity she had already reached, much before I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: If you have one of them in your life, never let go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Older Brother/Sister&lt;/strong&gt; : This is the your proverbial ‘4 AM friend’ you can call at any time and they are there for you- they are practically part of your family. They treat you how a sibling would- take care of you when you are inebriated, be brutally honest with you when you are out of line and lend you a shoulder to cry on when you are going through your worst. You may have your spats with them, but just like family, you bounce back like nothing ever happened. Again, I have had the pleasure of having several of them and without them, life would have been a lot harder to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: It is easy to get carried away and take them for granted because you know they will always be there for you. Avoid making that mistake at all cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Phony&lt;/strong&gt;: We have all met at least one person who we thought was a great friend, but really, were no where close to being one. You will always find them during your best times but never at your worst. You may make the mistake of trusting them with your deepest secrets and before you know it, it has spread like wildfire. I wish I could say you only meet these kinds in your middle school, but the truth is, the phony friend is always lurking around. A major warning sign is if they love to gossip- if they  vehemently gossip about others to you, chances are they are gossiping about you too. But the best way to flag such a ‘friend’ is to trust your gut. I realize now that every time I have met a potentially phony friend, something always bugged me about them, whether I did anything about it or not, is another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: never underestimate your instincts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Passive Aggressive&lt;/strong&gt; : These friends will make sure you feel guilty about possibly everything you do or do not do. You never feel comfortable around them because you can sense their judge-y eyes on you. If you have had to cancel a plan on them, they will be sure to shoot back a sugar-coated insulting text implying how disappointed they are in you. With them, it’s not about what they said, it is about how they said and it can make things rather awkward for you. The closer you get to the passive-aggressive friend, the higher the expectations. However, once you have set the boundaries, it gets easier to deal with them from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: Remember to maintain a decent distance from them and to not react the way they do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Elusive One&lt;/strong&gt;: This friendship is a sort of cat and mouse chase. You really enjoy spending time with this friend and you think they probably do as well, but planning anything with them or even catching up over a phone call is a task in itself. It seems like you are always chasing them and they keep slipping away. There may be innumerable reasons for this and chances are none of them are related to you but there comes a time when you got to stop. If the friendship is not giving you anything in return, it is a stale one and begins to look a lot like a one-sided friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: As long as your conscience is clear and you have tried reaching out from your end, there is no need to feel guilty about letting this one go. Friendship should always be shared.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The Passer-by&lt;/strong&gt;: So this is the classic acquaintance-disguised-as-a-friend one. They are probably your co-worker or your roommate and you both enjoy a good chat every time you meet. Sometimes, this may lead to forming great friendships however, a lot of times, we mistake this camaraderie to be a sign of a real friendship. You may presume that the friendship would last outside of the territory you currently share but soon realize that ain’t so! Nothing severe happens, you do not fight or feel negatively about them but some friendships are simply formed out of comfort and convenience. Once that is taken away from the equation, the friendship slowly implodes as well. The friendship you once thought would last beyond the space you two shared, may now be reduced to mere Facebook likes and the annual birthday wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: Not all friendships are deep but as long and as you know the limits of this friendship, you should continue to share a healthy equation with them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. The Social Media buddy&lt;/strong&gt;: With an over-exposure of social media in our lives, friendships are bound to be formed through them. The whole purpose of social media is really to participate in social networking and re-connecting with long-lost friends. However, the lines of friendship are blurred on social platforms and people you barely know can seem to be your new best friend and old friends you hoped to stay in touch with may be MIA by simply not being active on it. So who among them would you still call your true friend? Then there is the option of making new friends online- the possibilities are endless here. You may ‘meet’ someone you have never seen in person; possibly from another part of the world and yet feel a deep connection to. But that could go awfully wrong as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip: This one is quite tricky to get right, all that glitters may not be gold. But when it is, you have hit the jackpot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets tricky weeding out the good from the bad and we will not always succeed. We will overestimate the acquaintances, misjudge the true friends, and worst of all, trust the fake ones. But if we look deep within, each one of them has an important lesson to teach us; about friendship. About ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What It Is Really Like To Be An Only Child</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a steady rise in only children over the past decade, we as a group are grossly misunderstood. I have personally been bombarded with many strange and quite frankly, intrusive questions about why my parents chose not to have another child. They did not seem to fathom how a couple could feel complete with only a single offspring (as if!). There is something about an only child that paints a picture of loneliness and a lifetime worth of sorrow. My experience being an only child was certainly not linear; there have been times when I missed having a sibling. In fact, to this day I find it hard to understand the realms of sibling relationships. But would I trade my ‘only child’ perks for a sibling? No, thank you! Here are some qualities (the good, bad and ugly) that I think were strongly influenced because of my only child experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Extraversion&lt;/strong&gt;: Growing up, I was quite a hyper kid. One of the reasons my parents claim not to have gone for a second attempt was because I was already a handful! As a grown up, out of 10, I would say I am about a 7 of an extrovert. Sure, there are many other factors for my extraversion, but I know for a fact that me being alone at home gave me the motivation to go up to kids my age or even older to come play with me. My parents also moved a lot when I was growing up and I can remember at least 6 schools that I have studied in but I have never really had any problems making friends. Perhaps things would have been a little different if I had a sibling right at home, allowing me to remain in my comfort zone and not trying as hard to make friends. This has played an important role in me being a people-person even today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Stable relationship with my parents&lt;/strong&gt;: Only children do not know what it feels like to compete for their parents’ attention. Of course it really depends on the parents and whether they take it to the other extreme and spoil the child. I had well-balanced parents who gave me just the right amount of attention a child needs to feel loved and secure. The dynamics in my house is very different from the dynamics of say, my husband’s who has a younger sister. Since I did not grow up with a sibling, I formed a sort of friendship with my parents, especially my mother. In fact, I remember imagining my mom as being my elder sister at times because we really did share that kind of relationship. We would play games, she would take me out on her two-wheeler for rides, and I really just have a lot of good memories from my childhood which has been a determining factor in our relationship today; whenever the three of us have lived under one roof, it always feels like three friends having a good time. In contrast, my husband does not quite share that kind of relationship with his parents and does not open up to them as much. Him and his sister share a much closer bond with each other than their parents and I could be wrong but that seems to be a trend among a lot of children with siblings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. My independence&lt;/strong&gt;: When I turned 19 and decided to continue my education in the U.S while my parents decided to move back to India, a lot of people around me thought I was very brave to do so at such a young age and being “independent” was a tag I had been proudly given by my close friends and family. Although it certainly was a difficult time in my life, I think I was long prepared for such independent living. I was also a latch-key kid, so because both my parents worked, I would come home to no one else in the house but myself. As a child, I did have periods of boredom and loneliness but as I entered teenage, that quickly changed to a sense of freedom and taking care of myself. With no one to tell me when to do my homework or to eat, I practically taught myself to be organized and stick to a timeline. So when I did move out of the proverbial nest, it did not seem as hard as everyone was making it to be! And this takes me to my next point..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. My struggle with space&lt;/strong&gt;:  This is an ongoing one. I have always been aware of my problem with space. Either I give none or I want too much of it. When you grow up alone, you begin to enjoy your own company a lot. There was a lot of self-discovery at a very young age; I remember coming back home from school, I would blast the stereo system and just dance! I was not a great dancer as a kid but because I danced virtually every day, I became a sort of self-taught dancer. I also began writing short stories/keeping journals which gave birth to a very novice hobby-writing. It is also true that only children tend to talk to themselves more often than other kids. I did it all the time and this kick-started an early onset of self-reflection and introspection so, talking to yourself really isn’t as bad as they make it seem, is it?! But I also was a kid who craved for people’s attention. Since I was given a lot of it at home, I expected that to happen everywhere! Of course I learned it the hard way, but not before trying every possible way of seeking attention- at school and among friends. As I entered my late teens, it dwindled down quite a bit in fact, I began walking the other direction for a while there; just being in-tune with myself and being repelled when I got any attention at all! Like I said, this is an ongoing one. Now that I am married the boundaries of space are even more blurred. Luckily for me, my husband has somehow figured out exactly the right amount of attention and space I need which makes my life easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. My inability to share&lt;/strong&gt;: I do not think I was ever a spoiled child, and my parents never gave me more than I needed and I thank them for that. Since I had so many friends, I did learn to share things a lot. As far as I remember I did not struggle with that but surprisingly, I started seeing the repercussions as a grown up. Admittedly, I have trouble sharing my food with others. I also tend to get possessive about my books; it is hard for me to lend books to friends. Still, these are fairly insignificant things that can easily be overlooked. However, the problem starts when it seeps into the intangible- relationships. This is not a problem now as much as it was growing up. I remember as a child, if my mother ever thought another kid was cute or I saw an old picture of her with a random child, I would get jealous. This also seeped into my friendships where I would be bothered if my best friend spent more time with another one of hers and in fact, saw that as a sign of betrayal. I find it rather funny now that I am typing it all but at one point, those were serious issues. Thankfully that aspect of my personality no longer exists- or so I think. I think I always saw this as my biggest flaw, and after a lot of introspection and self-growth, I successfully brought it down a notch and is barely an issue anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never truly change though, and perhaps I will always be that talkative, independent girl who needs her space but also has a tough time sharing her food and her people. Being an only child is wonderful, complicated and unique and even with its shortcomings, I would not want to have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Law of Attraction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I stumbled upon this theory in a documentary many years ago, I was barely aware of its prominence in the world. I had certainly heard of quotes that relate to it, but I was blissfully ignorant about it for a very long time. So when I did come across it, I couldn’t stop thinking about it- whether it really works, and if it did, was this it? Was this answer to all our problems? The answer couldn’t be that simple, could it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading up a little more about it, to be more informed and here are 3 fundamental things you need to know about Law Of Attraction before you incorporate it into your life. I have practiced it in my own life once so far, and yes, it did work.For months I was trying to get my passport renewed in India where it kept getting stuck for some reason or the other and we needed it to be renewed well before my wedding so I could travel back with my husband right after the wedding. A bride to-be does not need more added stress in her life at that point, but I did and I was really down in the dumps when I decided to give LOA a real chance in my life. I really had nothing else going for me anyway. The real struggle was keeping the faith even when things kept going wrong constantly. I think we are wired to assume that if a change has to happen, it should be instant. I am still discovering it along the way, I do know that trust in the Law of Attraction is a very important element in it all. So let us trust, and read up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Language&lt;/strong&gt;: This is probably the most important one of them all, the very basic but also the most complicated. It is important to know that Law of Attraction gravitates towards either the positive language or the negative language you use- even if in both cases, you are thinking about overcoming an obstacle or even getting over mundane daily activities. For example, instead of saying “I can never get a good parking spot!”, go for “I hope I get a nice parking spot tomorrow”. Law of Attraction is based very highly on the type of language we use, not only the words we say out loud, but also the ones we think to ourselves. The LOA is based on the universe being attracted to the vibrations of positive or negative thinking/speaking/feeling, and give back exactly what you gave it. And yes, it is harder than it seems. This in fact, was the most challenging aspect for me and I consider myself a fairly optimistic person. But to exercise this when you are down in the dumps or when nothing is going right, now that is a challenge. Tip: Be conscious of what you are thinking or saying. If you catch yourself using negative language, correct yourself and re-phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a vision&lt;/strong&gt;: A very important aspect of LOA succeeding, is to visualize what you want. This helps you have a specific goal in mind when attracting it toward yourself rather than a vague one, which will probably hamper your chances of succeeding. In the case of the parking spot example, visualize an empty parking spot in the garage, each time you visualize, try to be as detailed as possible. The very famous documentary on LOA, The Secret shows that this exercise actually helped a man find a parking spot in his very crowded parking lot at work, almost every day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be reasonable with your goals&lt;/strong&gt;: If you set unrealistic goals or deadlines, it’s not going to happen. This is Law of Attraction, not a magic spell- so you need to remember to set practical goals that can be accomplished in the required time frame. So yes, there may be times when you won’t get the same parking spot every single day and that’s okay. If you can get a spot most times, you are still doing a whole lot better than before!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned before, I am still discovering LOA myself, however, I can safely say that during one of the most stressful times of my life last year, LOA pulled me, picked me up and gave me the kind of strength I most needed at the time. I learned that, patience and trust go hand in hand when it comes to LOA and as long as you are following the “Law” properly vis-à-vis the points mentioned above, you are on the right track and the Universe will sort itself out. There’s a lot more to be said about Law of Attraction of course, it is a Science in itself and I hope to learn a lot more about it along the way, and may be I’ll stop by and update some more when I do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Dignity It Deserves</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was clearing out my emails and many unsent drafts, I stumbled upon an old diary entry which I had jotted down many many years ago, almost 10! This was a significant time in my life when I was packing up and leaving the place I grew up in to start a whole new life in the U.S.A. Although a short entry, I think it perfectly describes what a typical teenager feels when her world is about to turn upside down. Ten years later, I am so comfortable in this world that, had it not been for diary entries like this one, I probably would have forgotten how challenging it really was for me to start afresh. So today, I want to post the diary entry here because it does not deserve to be buried in my unseen, neglected drafts anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the dignity it deserves, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21 June, 2007&lt;/strong&gt;: The Sun just set in for the day, leaving a violet blanket over the sky. I smell wet mud. Aah! Nothing smells better! Within minutes I hear the pitter-patter of the rain. Almost simultaneously, I hear my mom shouting at me. Unwillingly, I get down the window sill, muttering something to myself. The fact still not sunk in, I begin my packing. I look at the airline tickets for tomorrow. Afternoon flight to London and then off to our destination, New Jersey. I look up into my room. All I can see are the walls and my clothes strewn all over the floor. It began with a small tear and in no time I was crying out loud, shuddering. I couldn’t control. Did not want to. Memories of my time in the house, in my school began to play like a recorded tape. I never realized how lucky I was to have such great friends. The rain and the thunder seemed to grieve with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22nd June’07&lt;/strong&gt;: I wake up the next morning, still feeling down in the dumps. This was not feeling right. I felt so helpless. Completely dominated by gratifying ideas of running away, I get ready. The hour and a half ride to the international airport seemed to have passed within minutes. It’s time we got into the flight. At that moment I felt so vulnerable. How foolish was I to leave all that I have and enter a world I did not know?Something in my head tells me “Change is the only constant”. Oh puh-leez! Don’t gimme that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21st August ’07&lt;/strong&gt;: Two months later, here I am, sitting in what I now call my room, feeling nostalgic. I can’t say I am not homesick anymore, but life seems to have had a fresh start. Now, I can feel a flood of optimism in me. Something new and exciting awaits me. I am ready!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>MINDFULNESS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a snowy afternoon today, but I suppose I can’t expect much else in the middle of February. On days like these, I find myself in a rather contemplative mood; ready to feed my mind with some food. So, my husband and I decided to watch a documentary about intuition, called InnSaei. It goes into details defining, recognizing and quantifying intuition. It also teaches the audience various mindful exercises to communicate with our inner selves. The documentary itself is a great, informative tool for people like you and me who are consumed by the urgency of our day to day triviality. But the concept of mindfulness is not new to me; in fact having read research articles in my graduate school about the same, I know about its increasing popularity, especially in the corporate world. So I decided to dig some more and look at some of the latest data driven benefits of Mindfulness on psychological health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us first define what Mindfulness is. Mindfulness is paying attention on purpose. In short, Mindfulness is being present in the moment, being aware of whatever it is you are experiencing. Interestingly enough, the beginnings of Mindfulness were religious/spiritual in nature and can be found in Hindu and Buddhist scriptures, dating several centuries back. It is important to keep in mind that although meditation and yoga can cultivate mindfulness, it is not to be mistaken as a synonym for it. Mindfulness meditation includes self-regulation practices that focus on training attention and awareness in order to control mental processes and therefore increasing your general well-being. And precisely because of this, today, we can empirically use this as a construct for psychological well-being and it has indeed been applied in various studies and clinical settings. This, as I see it, is a perfect marriage of Spirituality and Science. Let’s look at some more of its benefits now shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced stress&lt;/strong&gt;: This really can’t be surprising. Similar to the findings on meditation and yoga, mindfulness meditation has been associated with reduced stress rate. it has been seen that the use of mindfulness-based therapy is useful in altering cognitive processes that can increase positive feelings (affect) and reduce anxiety and stress. Other important studies’ findings suggest that mindfulness meditation shifts people’s ability to use emotion regulation strategies in a way that enables them to experience emotion selectively, and that the emotions they experience may be processed differently in the brain (Farb et al., 2010; Williams, 2010).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Relapse Rate in Depression&lt;/strong&gt;: Relapse is an unfortunate problem in patients with depression and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been found to be a helpful tool to prevent relapse in these patients. MBCT is a form of therapy where cognitive therapy is combined with the meditative and self-regulatory practices pertaining to mindfulness. There have been many studies that have come to the conclusion that MBCT can help prevent depression recurrence as effectively as maintenance antidepressant medication did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosts Memory&lt;/strong&gt;: Improvement to working memory is another significant benefit seen from mindful meditation. A 2010 study by Jha et al.found that the group who practiced mindful meditation showed an increase in their working memory capacity compared to the control group. There have been more and more studies recently that have seen a positive correlation between mindful meditation and increased memory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Impulsive Reactions&lt;/strong&gt;: Being mindful of how you are feeling at the moment influences your actions and therefore, when you are aware of your vulnerability, you can keep your impulses in check. In other words, you can guide your emotions to not erupt or to calm yourself through this practice. In a study of people who had anywhere from one month to 29 years of mindfulness meditation practice, researchers found that mindfulness meditation practice helped people disengage from emotionally upsetting pictures and enabled them to focus better on a cognitive task as compared with people who saw the pictures but did not meditate (Ortner et al., 2007).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Distractions&lt;/strong&gt;: When we are performing tasks, especially routine ones, our minds tend to run on auto-pilot which makes us more vulnerable to distractions. Mindful meditation helps us focus on any particular activity you are doing. When you keep your mind in check, you make sure it remains focused on the said task and not get distracted easily. A study examined how mindfulness meditation affected participants’ ability to focus attention and suppress distracting information (Moore and Malinowski, 2009). They found that the meditation group had significantly better performance on all measures of attention and had higher self-reported mindfulness. So the next time you are brushing your teeth or driving your car, stop and focus on just that, and you may be surprised at what you learn even in daily routines like these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is easier said than done. We cannot possibly be mindful 24 hours of the day, but we don’t need to be either. I claim to be no expert in this matter but here are three easy tricks that  have helped me be more mindful throughout the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice on Daily Routines&lt;/strong&gt;: This goes back to my point above, I think you can truly be mindful when you play around with it with the most mundane and routine activities of the day. You may notice that when you focus on brushing your teeth, you actually do a good job of brushing your teeth. It’s as simple as that!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring yourself back&lt;/strong&gt;: This practice is very similar to meditation, especially when you are new to it and have to consciously stop your mind from wandering. In this case, when you are performing a task, say at work and you feel your mind wandering, make a conscious effort to bring it back to focus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your hand reaches out to that phone, stop yourself, may be switch it off and go back to what you were doing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Goes a Long Way&lt;/strong&gt;: Our minds respond better to short spans of mindfulness. According to Psychologists, being mindful several times a day is more helpful than one long session or weekend retreats. So start off with a few short spanned mindful tasks, and you will feel so much more productive for the rest of the day.
We are all wired differently. For some of us, it is easier to be pessimistic or allow negative emotions get the best of the us. Through mindfulness, we can channel those innate responses in a more positive manner and approach our inner and outer turmoils much more prudently. Now let’s get cracking, shall we?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
