I love to break stereotypes, and hate being boxed in one category- so I can’t define what kind of a page this is; but I can tell you this– it is a liminal extension of my mind, that is constantly seeking wisdom, new experiences and growth.

If I tell you that I am a happily married woman in her late twenties, working in the fun world of HR, and pretty content with life, I would probably sound very boring. Be as it may, I accept the “boring” side of me with great pride. Thankfully, we all go way beyond our marital status and age! This blog page was created to pen down everything else that I am about. I am passionate about coffee, baking, dancing and Harry Potter (Always!). I also welcome wise people and thoughts with open arms! With a Psychology and Sociology background, I can’t help but observe and analyze the world around me, and have no qualms about it either!

*Why this page?* Both my parents are great writers; each with a Master’s degree in Literature (talk about pressure!). While I don’t write as well as they do, I do have a writing bug that crawls out time and again. But really, it comes down to me having many opinions about many things and this blog was created in an attempt to articulate them. After all, as Ralph Emerson said “What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside of you”.
